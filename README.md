# sulptcomfortKarabiner
This adds functionality to the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse using a program called Karabiner on OSX. Tested on Yosimite 10.10.
To use: Install Karabiner and go to preferences. Under the "Misc & Uninstall" tab the ability to open private.xml can be found once opened through a text editor, paste the XML info in. Go back to the "Change Key" tab under preferences and refresh XML code. Select the options you wish to adopt, but note some of them are contradictory/repetitive. I just added them in case I wanted to switch between any.
